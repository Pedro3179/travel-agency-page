- Review the use of *anchor* elements.
- The use of the *target* attribute to indicate where the url will open.
- How to set the *target* to *_blank*, so it can open the link in an external window.
- How to use the meta element alongside *property="og:title"* to optimize my page to display content on social media.
- How to use *name="description"* in the meta element to optimize the code to SEO, with a short description of the web page content.
